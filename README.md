# Billing-Mangement-System
 This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple Bill Management application with a graphical user interface (GUI).
 The application allows the user to input quantities of various food items (such as Dosa, Cookies, Tea, Coffee, Juice, Pancakes, and Eggs) and calculates the total cost based on predefined prices for each item.
 Key features of the script:

Reset Button: Clears all input fields for a fresh entry.

Total Button: Calculates and displays the total cost of the selected items.

Menu Display: Provides a visual representation of the menu with corresponding prices.

GUI Layout: Utilizes frames and labels to organize the GUI components.

The application is designed for bill management, possibly in a restaurant or cafe setting, allowing users to input their order quantities and receive a total bill. The script also includes error handling to handle cases where input values are not valid integers.
